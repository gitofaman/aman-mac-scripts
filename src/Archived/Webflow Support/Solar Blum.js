When we had them installed we thought if we could just break even with our bills that would be great but after 12 months of having them installed we actually received a $182.60 credit for the year. We couldnt be happier about making the desicion to go with solar and SolarBlue. They were very knowledgable and professional from the sales to the installation and even their after sales service is fantastic, Phil is always happy to take my calls and discuss any questions i have. If you are thinking of going solar have a chat with these guys, you will not be dissapointed you did. We pay no power at all and even have money left over from our system. Thanks again Guys",

From the beginning with the setup to the end with production the whole team should be commended in their professionalism and helpfulness. I found these guys to be genuine and local, the best the Gong has to offer. Phil takes pride in his products that are offered with them being thoroughly tested and only selects value for money. Well done guys!",

Professional from start to finish. Extremely knowledgeable, polite and easy to deal with. Keep solar local everyone and use \"Solar Blu\". They installed my system and my father-in-laws and we couldn't be happier. I would recommend this business to anyone and have already started telling people to contact them. 2 months on since install and working like an absolute charm! Cheers boys",

Within about 10 days after my initial phone enquiry we had the team here doing the install with a 6.6kw system and it is absolutely cranking out the power. Thanks again for such a great job and getting us sorted so quickly. Great team with Andrew and his guys on site and Phil is a true gentleman to deal with. Our sincere thanks once again.

Phil from Solarblu came to our house to personally check the layout & explain our options. He also was very patient at answering all our questions. After negotiating a price, turnover was within a week. The team from Solarblu installed our solar panels & 3 phase inverter in a day. Phil returned after installation to personally check all was good & set up our WiFi dongle & our Smartphone app so we can monitor how much electricity we are producing. We’ve had our solar installation for 6 months & we are now in credit with our electricity bills. Couldn’t be happier with Solarblu. Highly recommended.
